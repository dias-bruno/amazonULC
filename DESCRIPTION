Description: The amazonULC package aims to provide land cover classification maps of Brazilian Amazonian cities.

The amazonULC provides a urban land cover classification for the cities of Altamira, Cametá, Marabá, Santarém and part of the Metropolitan Area of Belém, all in the state of Pará, Brazilian Legal Amazon.
