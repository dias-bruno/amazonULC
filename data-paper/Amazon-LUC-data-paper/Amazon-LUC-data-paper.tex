  \begin{abstract}
  Remote sensing has for decades been a primary method for collecting
  information about Earth's surface; in the case of developing nations,
  remotely sensed data is an important resource. Despite this, cities in
  the Amazonian region lack databases and cartographic publications. For
  this data paper, we select a group of four cities and one metropolitan
  region as study sites to provide land cover classification maps. Using
  imagery from the CBERS-4A satellite's WPM sensor, we created a
  classification model that combines the Geographic Object-Based Image
  Analysis method, data mining strategies, and a random forest machine
  learning algorithm. The results are valuable to discern different
  intra-urban land cover classes, with an overall accuracy level in the
  validation samples of over 85\%. An R package provide analysis-ready
  data and documentation to support researchers who wish to avail
  themselves of these resources.

\section{INTRODUCTION}\label{introduction}}

Remote sensing has been the primary method for collecting data about the
Earth's surface in recent years, particularly for developing countries
\citep{Zhu2022}. Numerous opportunities exist to map and monitor cities
using remote sensing data which provide accurate quantitative data over
time and space, and operate as the basis for physical, climatic, and
socioeconomic indicators, sometimes as a complement or even as an
alternative to conventional surveys such as the census. In addition,
these data can assist in urban planning once they are converted into
information and are consistently prepared and updated \citep{Weng2018}.

Land use and land cover mapping are the most significant applications of
remote sensing in urban studies in Brazilian cities \citep{Almeida2010}.
Despite this, most methods that use geoprocessing and remote sensing
tools to investigate Brazilian cities have concentrated on Southeastern
Brazil \citep{Santos2022}. Although research about urban areas in the
Amazonian region is not completely absent, public managers still need to
include such studies in public policies. This is somewhat complicated by
the lack of databases and cartographic publications specific to
Amazonian cities \citep{Cardoso2020}.

The Amazon region presents some unique characteristics. They include the
historical process of human occupation in a rain forest region, with
distinctive climatic and environmental characteristics. This is paired
with relatively low levels of socioeconomic development, a strong
cultural influence from indigenous peoples, sometimes complicated by
land and environmental conflict. In addition, the growth of small and
medium-sized cities is a characteristic of the urbanization process in
the Amazon, following the reorganization of the national urban network
and a new territorial division of labour
\citep{Trindade1998, Trindade2011}.

In this context, the objective of this data paper is to present an Open
Data Product (ODP) useful to support research and policy analysis in the
cities of Altamira, Cametá, Marabá, Santarém and part of the
Metropolitan Area of Belém. ODPs provide analysis-ready data often with
a value-added component \citep[see][]{arribas2021open}. Presently, we
obtain remotely sensed data from public sources; the value added comes
from the development of an urban land cover classification system for
the cities mentioned above. Using imagery from the CBERS-4A satellite's
WPM sensor, we created a classification model that includes the
Geographic Object-Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA) method, data mining
strategies, and a random forest machine learning algorithm.

This paper is an example of open and reproducible research that uses
only open software and data sources for imagery processing analysis. We
obtained all data from publicly available sources and organized in the
form of the Amazon-ULC R data package. In addition to the Open Data
Product, all the code necessary to reproduce, modify, and contribute to
the analysis is also shared, in line with best practices in spatial data
science \citep{brunsdon2021opening, DESJARDINS2022103091}.

\hypertarget{materials-and-methods}{%
\section{MATERIALS AND METHODS}\label{materials-and-methods}}

We summarise our methodology in five main steps, as follows.

The definition of the study area is the first step. The WPM image
preprocessing comes second, followed by the segmentation, extraction,
and selection features. The classification of the segments is the final
process. These steps are described in more detail below.

For this work, we used the following data:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  WPM images from the CBERS-4A satellite: orthorectified images,
  panchromatic and multispectral, from the year of 2020. The WPM sensor
  provides panchromatic and multispectral images simultaneously. The
  panchromatic images have 2 meters of spatial resolution, with a
  spectral range between 0.45 and 0.90 \(\mu\) m. Multispectral images
  have a spatial resolution of 8 meters, with spectral bands: blue
  (blue, 0.45 - 0.52 \(\mu\) m), green (green, 0.52 - 0.59 \(\mu\) m),
  red (red, 0.63 - 0.69 \(\mu\) m), NIR (near infrared, 0.77 - 0.89
  \(\mu\) m). The radiometric resolution of the images is 10 bits. The
  imaged swath width is 92 km and the revisit period is 31 days
  \citep{INPE2019};
\end{itemize}

The following software applications supported this research:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  QGIS 3.18 \citep{QGISTeam2021}: for the thematic maps, image
  segmentation.
\item
  TerraView 5.6.3: for preprocessing the satellite images, with the
  GeoDMA 2.0.1 add-on \citep{Korting2013} for extracting attributes.
\item
  Python \citep{vanRossum1995} and R Languages \citep{R2022} : preparing
  and mining the data and classifying the geographic objects with the
  Random Forest algorithm.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{study-areas}{%
\subsection{Study areas}\label{study-areas}}

Together, the study areas comprise about 1200 \(km^2\) located above the
municipal centers of Altamira (153 \(km^2\)), Cametá (44 \(km^2\)),
Marabá (164 \(km^2\)), Santarém (143 \(km^2\)) and part of the
Metropolitan Area of Belém (614 \(km^2\)), as study areas (Figure
\ref{fig:study-area}). All cities are located in the state of Pará,
within the Brazilian Legal Amazon. The study site also covers areas
classified as rural in the surroundings of the cities. For Altamira and
Cametá, we used the delimitation of dos Santos et al.
\citeyearpar{Santos2022}. For the other three study areas, we made the
delimitation according to the methodology of Gonçalvez et al.
\citeyearpar{Goncalves2021} - which uses night light images to identify
potentially populated areas. According to the \emph{Fundação Amazônia de
Amparo a Estudos e Pesquisas}, it is estimated that the municipalities
mentioned above have more than 3.5 million inhabitants, representing
more than 38\% of the population of the State of Pará.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=.8\linewidth]{images/location_map} \caption{\label{fig:study-area}Location of the study areas.}\label{fig:fig-1}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{pre-processing-image}{%
\subsection{Pre-processing image}\label{pre-processing-image}}

We started the pre-processing stage by cutting the images with the study
area polygons. Then, we fused the images with the Principal Components
Analysis (PCA) technique. Afterward, we calculated the following
indices:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI): division of the
  near-infrared (NIR) band by the red band, normalized, to analyze the
  presence and condition of vegetation (Equation 1): \[ 
  NDVI = \frac{NIR - RED}{NIR + RED}.
  \]
\item
  Normalized Difference Roof Index (NDRI): division of the red band by
  the blue band, normalized, to identify the presence of ceramic roofs
  and areas with exposed soil (Equation 2): \[ 
  NDRI = \frac{RED - BLUE}{RED + BLUE}.
  \]
\item
  Bare Soil Area Index (BAI): the normalized division of the blue band
  by the near-infrared band, to identify exposed soil (Equation 3): \[ 
  BAI = \frac{BLUE - NIR}{BLUE + NIR}.
  \]
\item
  Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI): the normalized division of
  the green band by the near-infrared band (Equation 4). This formula
  highlights the amount of water in water bodies: \[ 
  NDWI = \frac{GREEN - NIR}{GREEN + NIR}.
  \]
\end{itemize}

We obtained texture metrics from the Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix --
(GLCM) \citep{Haralick1973}. We computed all the GLCM metrics using 3 x
3 pixels as the window size. We also added fraction images produced by a
linear spectral mixture model (LSME). The LSME technique assumes that
given the spectral response of pure targets, it is possible to extract
highlighted features of the desired targets in a synthetic image format
- which would facilitate the identification of such targets. The LSME
uses a linear relationship to symbolize the spectral mixture of each
pixel target, and the spectral response is defined as a combination of
each component of the mixture, obeying a proportion between the
components whose summation equals \citep{Shimabukuro2019}.

In this study, we chose the pure pixels that served as the input to the
LSME model directly from the WPM multispectral images (with an 8-meter
spatial resolution), adopting the classes of vegetation, soil, and
water.

\hypertarget{image-segmentation-and-feature-extraction}{%
\subsection{Image segmentation and feature
extraction}\label{image-segmentation-and-feature-extraction}}

The fused WPM image was segmented using the Mean-shift algorithm.
Mean-shift is a region-based segmentation algorithm that uses local
homogenization, where each pixel is replaced by the average of pixels in
a search window whose value is within a predefined distance interval
\citep{Comaniciu1997}. Dos Santos performed LULC maps for Altamira,
Cametá and Marabá based on WPM imagery. The authors used the mean-shift
algorithm implemented in the Orfeo Toolbox (OTB) \citep{Grizonnet2017}.
The values for the spatial radius, range radius, maximum number of
interactions, and minimum region size determine the size and shape of
the segments. Therefore, we adopt the following values: spatial radius
of 5 pixels, range radius of 100 pixels, maximum number of interactions
100 times, and minimum region size of 15 pixels.

We defined classes of objects by size and shape aiming to identify the
land cover classes: ``Shrub Vegetation'' (SV), ``Herbaceous Vegetation''
(HV), ``Water'' (Wa), ``Exposed Ground'' (EG), ``High Gloss Cover''
(HG), ``Ceramic Cover'' (Ce), ``Fiber Cement Cover'' (FC), ``Asphalt
Road'' (As), ``Terrain Road'' (Te), ``Cloud'' (Cl) and ``Shadow'' (Sh).

After segmenting the WPM images, we extracted features for the
geographic objects. We extracted spatial features and the mean, maximum,
minimum, standard deviation, and range values of the biophysical index
layers, GLCMs, multispectral, and fraction images.

\hypertarget{feature-extraction}{%
\subsection{Feature extraction}\label{feature-extraction}}

We employed a stratified random sampling following the prevalent land
cover classes. We set 70\% of samples for training and the remaining
30\% for validation. After sampling, the variables underwent a
pre-classification treatment process, where potential \texttt{null}
values were filled in. We next ordered the variables based on their
ability to distinguish between different interest classes. We used the
\(R^2\) from the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) for the ordering. Due to
their poor ability to discriminate between classes, we eliminated the
attributes with \(R^2\) lower than 0.1.

\hypertarget{classification-model}{%
\subsection{Classification Model}\label{classification-model}}

We developed a supervised classification model using the training base
with the random forest (RF) algorithm for each city. We used the
Randomized Search technique to define the RF model's hyperparameters. In
this technique, we input the algorithm values of hyperparameters that
will be randomly selected and combined, returning a combination that
results in the best possible classification. The method selects the
optimal set of hyperparameters using a performance metric and a fixed
number of iterations. Randomized Search uses cross-validation, dividing
the training base into \(k\) parts (folds), and the model is trained and
evaluated \(k\) times. The algorithm chooses a component (fold) for each
iteration to use as an evaluation before training the model on the other
\(k-1\) parts.

We examined the hyperparameter values listed in Table 1 using Randomized
Search. We used a 5-fold cross-validation, an F1-Score performance
indicator, and a maximum of 100 parameter combinations (iterations).
After the Random-search selecting the best hyperparameters for the RF
model, we classified the entire database.

\section{RESULTS}\label{results}}

We developed a land cover classification model for each city. The
database contains the set of model hyperparameters that produced the
best classification. The metrics F1-Score Macro (average of the F1-Score
of the different classes), F1-Score Weighted (average of the F1-Score of
the different classes weighted by the number of samples), and Global
Accuracy of the classification produced by the RF model over the
validation samples are presented in Table 2 for each study area.

\bottomrule()
\end{longtable}

According to statistics, the developed models obtained Macro F1-Scores
above 75\%, Weighted F1-Scores and Global Accuracy above 85\%. These
high rates show that the RF model's classification successfully
classified most of the validation samples, demonstrating a good capacity
for classifying data not used in the model's development. Visually, it
is noticeable that the result is satisfactory and in line with the
evaluation metrics (Figure \ref{fig:fig-land-cover-classes}).

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=.8\linewidth]{images/ULC_Legend_v2-tile} \caption{\label{fig:fig-land-cover-classes}Urban land cover classification maps of Altamira, Cametá, Belém Metropolitan Area, Marabá and Santarém.}\label{fig:fig-2}
\end{figure}

When evaluated using statistical assessment metrics, Santarém had the
best classification. We can explain the better performance of the
classification model for Santarém because this study site had a more
significant number of samples collected, facilitating the identification
of the coverage classes by the algorithm.

In general, the Vegetation classes (Shrub and Herbaceous) and the Water
class presented the highest F1-Score. It might be explained by the
spectral nature of these classes, which are easily distinguished. On the
other hand, the Fiber cement and Ceramic classes had the worst F1-Score
- both present spectral characteristics similar to the Asphalt Road and
Earth Road classes, respectively, which would justify the higher
confusion on the part of the classifier algorithm.

\hypertarget{study-limitations}{%
\section{STUDY LIMITATIONS}\label{study-limitations}}

This work seeks to provide land cover bases for five locations in the
Brazilian Legal Amazon. However, although it has met its objective, some
limitations must be pointed out.

The methodology we adopted for the satellite image classification was
the GEOBIA approach. This technique requires a segmentation process over
the image, grouping the pixels of similar spectral performance. However,
we noticed that some targets were not completely separated during the
segmentation process, compromising the classification result by the
classifier algorithm. This segmentation error was more noticeable in the
city of Marabá. Consequently, ``not pure'' segments were identified,
i.e., segments that could be divided into two or more classes. It is
essential to mention that this limitation is due to the our decision to
use only algorithms available in open-access software.

Another point to be raised is that even if the classification accuracy
levels are considered satisfactory by the research team, it is still
possible to find segments misclassified by the Random Forest algorithm.

\hypertarget{conclusion}{%
\section{CONCLUSION}\label{conclusion}}

This work aimed to provide land cover classification maps for Brazilian
Amazonian cities. Land cover maps can contribute to urban planning in
Amazonian cities, with applications for monitoring urban sprawl,
building in environmental protection areas, assisting in urban zoning,
and identifying areas of high building density, among others. Our
classification model used images from the WPM sensor of the CBERS-4A
satellite and combined the GEOBIA approach, data mining techniques and
the Random Forest machine learning algorithm. The results obtained are
promising regarding the ability to discriminate intra-urban cover
classes, achieving an overall accuracy level above 85\% in the
validation samples for all study areas. The integration between the
GEOBIA approach and a machine learning algorithm was the reason for this
success. In addition, this work also emphasizes the application of the
CBERS-4A satellite, recently launched by the Brazilian government in
partnership with the Chinese government, for Amazon urban studies.
